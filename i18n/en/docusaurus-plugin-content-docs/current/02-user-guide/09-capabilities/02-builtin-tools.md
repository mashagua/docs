# Built-in Tools Reference

Built-in tools are basic capabilities that come with DesireCore, installed with the client, ready to use without additional configuration. Below is the complete list of all built-in tools.

## File Operations

**Typical Use Cases**: View code files, read documents, view configuration files, preview images.

### Write — Write File

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Medium |
| Requires Confirmation | Yes |

**Typical Use Cases**: Create new files, save generated content, update configuration files.

### Edit — Edit File

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Medium |

## Search and Browse

### Glob — Search File Names

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Low |
| Requires Confirmation | No |

Search files in directory by pattern. Supports glob wildcard patterns (e.g., `**/*.ts`). Prioritizes high-performance fd tool, automatically respects .gitignore rules.

**Typical Use Cases**: Find specific file types, locate configuration files in projects, search for test files.

### Grep — Search File Content

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Low |
| Requires Confirmation | No |

Search for matching text content in files. Supports regular expressions and context line count. Prioritizes high-performance ripgrep, automatically respects .gitignore rules.

**Typical Use Cases**: Search for function calls in code, find specific error messages, locate keywords in documents.

### Ls — List Directory Contents

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Low |
| Requires Confirmation | No |

List all files and subdirectories in specified directory. Shows file sizes, supports recursive mode. Skips hidden files by default.

**Typical Use Cases**: Browse project structure, view file lists in directories, understand project organization.

## Command Execution

### Bash — Execute Command

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | High |
| Requires Confirmation | Yes |

Execute shell commands. Supports pipes, redirects, and other shell features. Cross-platform support (bash on macOS/Linux, Git Bash on Windows). Has timeout protection and output truncation mechanism.

**Typical Use Cases**: Run build commands, execute tests, install dependencies, view system status.

:::warning High Risk Operation
Command execution is a high-risk operation requiring your confirmation every time. The agent will display the complete command to be executed in the confirmation dialog—please read carefully before confirming.

### Which — Check Command Availability

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Low |
| Requires Confirmation | No |

Check if one or more command-line tools are installed in the system and return executable file paths.

**Typical Use Cases**: Check if tools are installed before executing commands.

## Network

### WebFetch — Fetch Webpage

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Low |
| Requires Confirmation | No |

Search the internet for latest information. Supports domain whitelist and blacklist filtering.

**Typical Use Cases**: Find latest technical materials, search for problem solutions, get real-time information.

## Agent Collaboration

### spawn_agent — Spawn Sub-agent

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Risk Level | Medium |
| Requires Confirmation | Yes |

Spawn a temporary sub-agent to handle specific subtasks. Sub-agents have independent context and tool sets, suitable for breaking complex tasks into independent sub-problems.

**Typical Use Cases**: Process multiple independent subtasks in parallel, split complex problems to specialized sub-agents.

### handoff — Handoff Session
